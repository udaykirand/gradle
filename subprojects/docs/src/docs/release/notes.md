The Gradle team is excited to announce Gradle 5.2.

This release features the [Java Platform plugin](userguide/java_platform_plugin.html) which allows users to declare and publish platforms including as BOMs, [official support for additional Windows native toolchains](userguide/native_software.html#native-binaries:tool-chain-support), and more.

Read the [Gradle 5.x upgrade guide](userguide/upgrading_version_5.html) to learn about breaking changes and considerations for upgrading from Gradle 5.0. If upgrading from Gradle 4.x, please read 
[upgrading from Gradle 4.x to 5.0](userguide/upgrading_version_4.html) first. Users upgrading from 5.1, should not have to worry about breaking changes.

## Upgrade Instructions

Switch your build to use Gradle 5.2 by updating your wrapper properties:

`./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=5.2`

Standalone downloads are available at [gradle.org/release-candidate](https://gradle.org/release-candidate). 

## The Java Platform plugin

A new plugin, the [Java Platform plugin](userguide/java_platform_plugin.html) allows the declaration and publication of platforms for the Java ecosystem.
A platform is typically published as a bill-of-material (BOM) file, and can be used as a source of recommendations for versions, between projects or externally.
Read the [Java Platform plugin section of the userguide](userguide/java_platform_plugin.html) for more details.

## Maven publication: expose resolved versions

When using the [`maven-publish` plugin](userguide/publishing_maven.html), you can now opt-in to publish the _resolved_ dependency versions instead of the _declared_ ones.
For details, have a look at the [dedicated section](userguide/publishing_maven.html#publishing_maven:resolved_dependencies) in the plugin documentation.

## Building Native software with Gradle 

See more information about the [Gradle native project](https://github.com/gradle/gradle-native/blob/master/docs/RELEASE-NOTES.md#changes-included-in-gradle-52).

### Support for additional Windows native toolchains

In previous versions of Gradle, native builds using GCC with [cygwin64](https://www.cygwin.com/) or [mingw64](https://mingw-w64.org/doku.php) was reported to work, but was not officially supported.
These toolchains are now officially supported by Gradle. See [the userguide](userguide/native_software.html#native-binaries:tool-chain-support) for more information about supported native toolchains.

### Support for testing applications on Windows

Gradle now automatically hides the main symbol when building native applications, so applications can be tested on Windows like they already were on macOS and Linux.

## Rich console improvements on Windows

This release includes some improvements to Gradle's console integration on Windows. Gradle now detects when it is running from Mintty on Windows and enables the rich console. Mintty is a popular terminal emulator used by projects such as Cygwin and Git for Windows. 

The implementation of the rich console has been improved to remove some distracting visual artifacts on Windows. 

## Improvements for plugin authors 

### Service injection into project extensions

Previously, Gradle supported [service injection into tasks](userguide/custom_tasks.html#service_injection) and [service injection into plugins](userguide/custom_plugins.html#service_injection). In 
this Gradle release, these services are also available for injection directly into project extensions. Using this can help simplify your plugin implementation.

See the [user manual](userguide/custom_plugins.html#service_injection) for details.

## Support for setting environment variables when using Gradle TestKit
  
Gradle [TestKit](userguide/test_kit.html) based tests can now specify environment variables via [`GradleRunner`](javadoc/org/gradle/testkit/runner/GradleRunner.html). These environment variables will be visible to the build under test.

## Annotation processor improvements

Sources generated by annotation processors are now put in a separate directory by default, which means they will no longer pollute your production jar file.

Due to a bug in javac, users would often get warnings about unrecognized processor options during incremental compilation, because the corresponding processor did not need to run. This warning is now fixed and will only appear if an option is really unrecognized.

## `JavaExec` tasks track the version of Java used

Tasks that use `JavaExec` now track the version of Java used instead of the absolute path to the `java` executable.
